# React_CRUD
A plain and simple practical representation of CRUD app done using REACT JS.

This may not be the best practical example of a REACT CRUD app, but this is my first attempt using REACT Js.

All the React libraries are imported into the project using CDN links (Both React and ReactDOM are available over a CDN)

REACT : https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.development.js
REACTDOM : https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.development.js

Using JSX and ES6 we can be more productive while working with React. But the JSX syntax and ES6, are not supported in all the browsers.
Hence, we need to use a tool which translates them to the format that has been supported by the browsers. Itâ€™s where babel comes into the picture.

BABEL : https://unpkg.com/babel-standalone@6/babel.min.js
